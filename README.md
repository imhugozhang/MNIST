# MNIST
The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning.

This project is about creating a model to identify pictures with digits 0,1,2,3,...9 written on them. E.g. input a picture with hand-drawn 1 on it, output 1.

Performing the same task with 3 different methods, including Scikit-learn, Keras, Tensorflow.

Run pip install -r requirements.txt or pip3 install -r requirements.txt to install dependencies.

Unzip mnist_train_small.zip to get the dataset.

Run MNIST.py

Use dir = os.getcwd() on Jupyter Notebook or dir = os.path.dirname(file) on Command Line local runtime.
