# MNIST
The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning.

This project is about creating a model to identify pictures with digits 0,1,2,3,...9 written on them. E.g. input a picture with hand-drawn 1 on it, output 1.
